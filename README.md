# About

A repository to show examples of 
[Lotus controllers](http://lotusrb.org/guides/actions/overview/) in action for 
[WMRUG](http://www.meetup.com/West-Midlands-Ruby-User-Group-WMRUG/).

This project is a simple barebones rack app that just uses the controller
gem from Lotus and nothing else other than rack dependencies.
